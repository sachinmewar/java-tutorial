   In Java String is a sequence of character.
   But unlike other prog. languages like C and C++ which takes string as a character array, In java String is an object of type String.
   
   String str = new String();

   String in Java is immutable, each time you need an altered version of an existing string,
   a new String object is created that contains the modifications. The original string is left unchanged.
   This approach is used because immutable strings can be implemented more efficiently than changeable ones.

   For those cases in which a modifiable string is desired, Java provides two options:
   StringBuffer and StringBuilder.
   Both hold strings that can be modified after they are created.
