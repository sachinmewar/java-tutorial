 * The Creation of Java:
   * Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc.
     in 1991. It took 18 months to develop the first working version.
   * This language was initially called “Oak,” but was renamed “Java” in 1995.
   * The primary motivation of Java was the need for a platform-independent language that could be used to create
     software to be embedded in various consumer electronic devices, such as microwave ovens and remote controls.
   * The trouble with C and C++ is that they are designed to be compiled for a specific target.
   * Although it is possible to compile a C++ program for just about any type of CPU, to do so requires a full C++
     compiler targeted for that CPU.
   * The problem is that compilers are expensive and time-consuming to create.
   * Java might have remained a useful but obscure language for programming consumer electronics. However, with the
     emergence of the World Wide Web, Java was propelled to the forefront of computer language design,
     because the Web, too, demanded portable programs.
   * At that time much of the computer world had divided itself into the three competing camps of Intel, Macintosh,
     and UNIX, most programmers stayed within their fortified boundaries, and the urgent need for
     portable code was reduced.
   *  However, with the advent of the Internet and the Web, the old problem of portability returned with a vengeance.
      After all, the Internet consists of a diverse, distributed universe populated with various types
      of computers, operating systems, and CPUs.
   * By 1993, it became obvious to members of the Java design team that the problems of portability frequently
     encountered when creating code for embedded controllers are also found when attempting to create code for the
     Internet.
   *  In fact, the same problem that Java was initially designed to solve on a small scale could also be applied to the
   Internet on a large scale.
   * So, while the desire for an architecture-neutral programming language provided the initial spark, the Internet
     ultimately led to Java’s large-scale success.
