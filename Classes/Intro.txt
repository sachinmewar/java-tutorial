The data, or variables, defined within a class are called instance variables.
The code is contained within methods. Collectively, the methods and variables
defined within a class are called members of the class. In most classes, the
instance variables are acted upon and accessed by the methods defined for that
class. Thus, as a general rule, it is the methods that determine how a classâ€™ data
can be used.
Variables defined within a class are called instance variables because each
instance of the class (that is, each object of the class) contains its own copy of
these variables. Thus, the data for one object is separate and unique from the
data for another. We will come back to this point shortly, but it is an important
concept to learn early.
