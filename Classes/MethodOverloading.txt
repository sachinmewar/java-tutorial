  * Method Overloading:
    * In Java, it is possible to define two or more methods within the same class that share the same name, as long as their
      parameter declarations are different this process is known as method overloading.
    * Method overloading is one of the ways that Java supports polymorphism.
    * When an overloaded method is invoked, Java uses the type and/or number of arguments to determine which overloaded
      method to call. The return type alone is insufficient to distinguish two versions of a method.
    * Method overloading supports polymorphism as it is one way that Java implements the “one interface, multiple methods”
      paradigm.
