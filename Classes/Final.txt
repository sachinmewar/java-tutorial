  * Introducing final :
    * final keyword is used to prevent the contents of a field from being modified, making it a constant.
    * There are two ways to declare final field: First, give it a value when it is declared. Second,
      assign it a value within a constructor.
    * Both method parameters and local variables can be declared as final. Declaring a parameter final prevents it from
      being changed within the method. Declaring a local variable final prevents it from being
      assigned a value more than once.
    * The keyword final can also be applied to methods, but its meaning is substantially different than when it is applied
      to variables.
