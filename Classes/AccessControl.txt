 * Access Specifiers:
   * Javaâ€™s access modifiers are public, private, protected and default.
   * protected applies only when inheritance is involved (Only child class can access).
   * When a member of a class is public, then that member can be accessed by any other code.
   * When a member of a class is private, then that member can only be accessed by other members of its class.
