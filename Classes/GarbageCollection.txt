  * Garbage Collection:
    * Whenever the objects are allocated dynamically we do need to free them to release memory.
    * In C++, dynamically allocated objects must be manually released by using delete operator.
    * Java free your memory automatically by using a technique know as Garbage Collection.
    * When no reference to an object exist, then that object cannot be used and is assumed to be no longer needed and the
      memory occupied by the object can be reclaimed. There is no need to explicitly destroy objects.
    * Garbage collection only occurs sporadically(if at all) during the execution of your program. It will not occur simply
      because one or more objects exist that are no longer used. Furthermore, different Java run-time implementations will
      take varying approaches to garbage collection.
